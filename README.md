## Project Insight

1. Loan applications have shown consistent monthly growth from January (2.3K) to December (4.0K).

2.  Although bad loans are few(13.82%), their recovery rate is poor.

3. Higher interest loans(13.89%, 15.13%) correlate with increased default risk.

4. DTI (Avg. DTI=13.33%) is a critical default predictor. Consider setting stricter DTI limits in approval policy.

5. Applications are highest in some states (up to 6.9K), lowest in others (<2K).

6. Loan applications are strong across all employment groups (10+ years: 4.6K , 2 years: 4.4K, <1 year: 4.1K ). 

7. Majority are Renters(18.4K)  followed by Mortgage(17.1K) , implying higher credit risk.
